# Hive website

This subproject is to be used to render more complicated webpages so we don't have to hack static js files and inline jQuery.

There is a full react toolchain in this directory so anything you can do with react/node you can
use this project for.

## Setup
```
yarn install
```

## Start hot reloading server
```
yarn dev
```

## Build static assets
```
yarn build
```
